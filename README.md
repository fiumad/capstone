# ASIC Devices for LiDAR Improvement

### Purpose
The goal of this project is to automate the optimization of a pre-existing differential amplifier design using machine learning techniques.

TargetApproach/ contains the code for the final approach used to generate a differential amplifier design.

transimpedance_prediction/ contains code for the flawed alternative approach and is considered deprecated.

test/ contains introductory code that was used for learning pytorch and other libraries used.
